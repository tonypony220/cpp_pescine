The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 302 Found redirect status response code indicates that              resource requested has been temporarily moved to              URL given by              Location header. A browser redirects to this page but search engines don't update             ir links to              resource (in 'SEO-speak', it is said that              'link-juice' is not sent to              new URL). Even if              specification requires              method (and              body) not to be altered when              redirection is performed, not all user-agents conform here - you can still find this type of bugged software out             re. It is             refore recommended to set              302 code only as a response for GET or HEAD methods and to use 307 Temporary Redirect instead, as              method change is explicitly prohibited in that case. In             cases where you want              method used to be changed to GET, use 303 See O            r instead. This is useful when you want to give a response to a PUT method that is not              uploaded resource but a confirmation message such as: 'you successfully uploaded XYZ'.
