The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 302 Found redirect status response code indicates that OOOO resource requested has been temporarily moved to OOOO URL given by OOOO Location header. A browser redirects to this page but search engines don't update OOOOir links to OOOO resource (in 'SEO-speak', it is said that OOOO 'link-juice' is not sent to OOOO new URL). Even if OOOO specification requires OOOO method (and OOOO body) not to be altered when OOOO redirection is performed, not all user-agents conform here - you can still find this type of bugged software out OOOOre. It is OOOOrefore recommended to set OOOO 302 code only as a response for GET or HEAD methods and to use 307 Temporary Redirect instead, as OOOO method change is explicitly prohibited in that case. InOOOO cases where you want OOOO method used to be changed to GET, use 303 See OOOOOr instead. This is useful when you want to give a response to a PUT method that is not OOOO uploaded resource but a confirmation message such as: 'you successfully uploaded XYZ'.
